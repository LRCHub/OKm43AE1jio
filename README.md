[00:04.79] My heart's a stereo
[00:07.68] It beats for you, so listen close
[00:10.30] Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
[00:15.39] Make me your radio
[00:18.26] And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
[00:21.14] This melody was meant for you (right there)
[00:23.89] Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)
[00:49.39] 
[00:27.49] If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
[00:29.93] Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
[00:32.50] If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
[00:35.26] Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
[01:02.26] 
[00:37.99] Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
[00:40.57] It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
[00:43.29] I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
[00:45.94] 'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
[01:12.44] 
[00:48.70] If I could only find a note to make you understand
[00:51.21] I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
[00:53.99] Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
[00:56.71] And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you
[01:22.21] 
[01:00.02] My heart's a stereo
[01:03.40] It beats for you, so listen close
[01:06.13] Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
[01:11.45] Make me your radio
[01:14.31] And turn me up when you feel low
[01:17.02] This melody was meant for you
[01:19.62] Just sing along to my stereo
[01:33.62] 
[01:22.25] (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) to my stereo
[01:27.12] (Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
[01:32.66] Let's go!
[01:37.16] 
[01:33.90] If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
[01:36.79] Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
[01:39.25] Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
[01:41.88] And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
[02:07.88] 
[01:44.79] And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
[01:47.55] When you have to purchase mad D batteries
[01:49.84] Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
[01:52.64] You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
[02:25.64] 
[01:55.54] I think I finally found a note to make you understand
[01:57.94] If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
[02:00.78] Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
[02:03.34] You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
[02:29.34] 
[02:06.81] My heart's a stereo
[02:10.18] It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
[02:12.92] Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
[02:17.82] Make me your radio (come on)
[02:20.95] And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
[02:23.76] This melody was meant for you
[02:26.27] Just sing along to my stereo (sing along like)
[02:49.27] 
[02:28.79] (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) to my stereo
[02:33.68] (Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
[02:55.68] 
[02:39.32] I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
[02:44.32] Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
[02:49.78] I take your hand, hold it closer to mine (yeah)
[02:54.98] Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
[03:21.98] 
[03:00.60] My heart's a stereo
[03:03.70] It beats for you, so listen close
[03:06.46] Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
[03:11.13] Make me your radio
[03:14.16] And turn me up when you feel low
[03:17.02] This melody was meant for you
[03:19.75] Just sing along to my stereo
[03:33.75] 
[03:22.05] (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) to my stereo (it's your boy, Travie)
[03:27.28] (Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo (yeah)
