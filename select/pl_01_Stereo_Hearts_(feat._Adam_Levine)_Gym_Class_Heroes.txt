[Chorus 1 - Adam Levine] My heart's a stereo It
beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts
in every note, oh oh Make me your radio Turn me
up when you feel low This melody was meant for
you To sing along to my stereo  Gym Class Heroes
baby  [Verse 1] If I was just another dusty
record on the shelf Would you blow me off and
play me like everybody else If I asked you to
scratch my back Could you manage that? Travie I
could handle that Furthermore I apologize for
any skipping tracks It's just the last girl
that played me left a couple cracks I used to-
used to- used to-  used to now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love  is ancient
artifacts If I could only find the note  to make
you understand I'd sing it softly in your ear
and grab you by the hands Keep it stuck inside
your head  like your favorite tune And know my
heart's a stereo  that only plays for you
[Chorus 1]  [Chorus 2 - Adam Levine] Oh oh oh oh
oh oh To my stereo Oh oh oh To sing along to my
stereo  Let's go  [Verse 2] If I was an old
school fifty pound boom box Would you hold me on
your shoulder  wherever you walked Would you
turn my volume up  in front of the cops And
crank it higher every time  they told you to
stop And all I ask is that you don't get mad at
me When you have to purchase mad d batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make You
never know we come  and go like on the
interstate I think I finally found the note  to
make you understand If you can hit it sing along
and take me by the hands Keep me stuck inside
your head  like your favorite tune You know my
heart's a stereo  that only plays for you
[Chorus 1]  [Chorus 2]  [Bridge - Adam Levine] I
only pray you'll never leave me  behind (never
leave me) Because good music can be  so hard to
find (so hard to find) I'll take your head and
hold it closer to mine Thought love was dead
but now you're changing my mind  [Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
